# Installation

This package can be used in any PHP project, but is mainly focused on being used with TYPO3 installations.

Since this is our main focus, the package can be used in both Composer mode and with non-composer installations to
support legacy TYPO3 installations.

## Requirements

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) v2 or above
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) v8.1 or higher

## Composer

How to install the package in a Composer PHP project.

:::tip

This is the recommended way to use the package.

:::

### Install

```bash
composer require typoconsult/quickpay
```

On successful install you can continue to the [usage page](/docs/getting-started/usage)

## Without Composer

If you wish to use this package with a TYPO3 installation that does not use Composer, you can follow the steps below to
get it up and running.

:::caution

It requires more manuel setup to get this to work, and is therefore more error-prone.

Always use [Composer](/docs/getting-started/installation#composer) if possible.
